Description

iptreport is composed by an systemV script who load the iptables rules at start up and a script of iptables log analysis. 

The script's start-up loaded is rc.iptables and the iptables rules are located in the ipt_rules script. It must be situated in an executable directory 
as it describe in the environnement variable $PATH. The iptables rules is made for a laptop computer, so there is a lack of network information
and interface used. 3 kind of information is logged on the file /var/log/iptables.log : INPUT traffic, packet NEW but not with the SYN flag, and divers 
kind of attack (portscan, SYN flood, XMAS, NULL).

The second part of this repository is dedicated for the analyse of the log file. A bash script named ipt_analysis call an AWK script to extract the 
information. It makes more readable the information and store the files in the directory /usr/local/iptreport. ipt_analysis can be used in the cron daemon.
